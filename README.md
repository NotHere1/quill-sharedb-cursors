# Quill-ShareDB-Cursors
An attempt at multi cursors sync in a collaborative editing scenario using [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) and [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb).

Implemented by @pedrosanta while working at [Reedsy](https://reedsy.com/#/freelancers).

Check out a working demo at [](https://quill-sharedb-cursors.herokuapp.com).
