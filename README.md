# Quill-ShareDB-Cursors
An attempt at multi cursors sync in a collaborative editing scenario using [Quill](https://quilljs.com/), [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb) and [reeds/quill-cursors](reeds/quill-cursors) module.

Implemented by [pedrosanta](https://github.com/pedrosanta) while working at [Reedsy](https://reedsy.com/#/freelancers).

A working demo is available at: https://quill-sharedb-cursors.herokuapp.com
